Created a Blog website with CRUD operations, where user can also create 
account login, register, update there account information. Used Flask for
backend and SQLAlchemy orm for the database for persistent memory.

Added a .yaml file in github/workflows to automate basic continuous integration
operations.

Create an .env file, copy paste the 2 line code from .env.example and use 
your own keys to play with it.
